# Gold Price Prediction using Random Forest

This project demonstrates how to predict gold prices using a Random Forest Regressor model in Python. It uses historical gold price data and other relevant features to train the model and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is "gld_price_data.csv," which contains historical gold prices and other relevant features such as stock market indices (SPX, USO, SLV, EUR/USD).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries using pip:
2. Upload the "gld_price_data.csv" dataset to your Google Colab environment or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the Python code provided in the notebook.
4. The code will:
    - Load and preprocess the dataset.
    - Split the data into training and testing sets.
    - Train a Random Forest Regressor model.
    - Evaluate the model's performance using R-squared, MAE, and RMSE.
    - Visualize the predicted vs. actual gold prices.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using R-squared, MAE, and RMSE. You can find the results printed in the output of the code.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this project by improving the model, adding new features, or enhancing the visualizations.
